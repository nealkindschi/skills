# ATS Resume Optimizer

Optimize a user's resume for a specific job posting using the full Applicant Tracking System research report (`references/ats-report.md`). Every recommendation or change must cite the relevant report section.

## Workflow

```
Progress:
- [ ] Phase 1: Gather inputs (resume, job posting URL, region, output preference)
- [ ] Phase 2: Research ATS vendor
- [ ] Phase 3: Five-dimension analysis
- [ ] Phase 4: Generate output(s)
```

### Phase 1: Gather Inputs

Ask the user for:

1. **Resume**: Accept PDF, DOCX, TXT, or markdown (`.md`) files. Read the file and extract all text.
2. **Job posting URL**: Fetch the URL with WebFetch to get the full job description text.
3. **Region**: Default to US. Ask: "Is the company based in the United States, or another region (EU, UAE, etc.)? Regional context can affect ATS keyword strategies." Load `references/regional-guide.md` if the user specifies a non-US region.
4. **Output preference**: Ask: "Which output would you like? (A) A recommendations document listing changes to make, (B) A rewritten/optimized resume, or (C) Both."

### Phase 2: Research ATS Vendor

Scan the job posting page for vendor indicators. Check:

- **URL patterns**: `myworkdayjobs.com`, `greenhouse.io`, `taleo.net`, `icims.com`, `successfactors.com`, `eightfold.ai`, `lever.co`, `ashbyhq.com`, `bamboohr.com`, `jobvite.com`
- **Page footer/text**: "Powered by Workday", "Powered by Greenhouse", Taleo branding, iCIMS copyright, SAP/SuccessFactors mentions
- **Application form**: Vendor-specific UI elements, domain redirects on "Apply" button

If a vendor is identified, load `references/vendor-guide.md` and read the relevant vendor profile. Apply vendor-specific strategies in Phase 3.

If no vendor is found, note this and apply general best practices from the report, which are valid across all major ATS platforms.

### Phase 3: Five-Dimension Analysis

Analyze the resume against the job description across these dimensions. For each finding, cite the relevant section of `references/ats-report.md`.

#### Dimension 1: Format Compliance

Check the resume for ATS parsing risks identified in the report (Section: Parsing Failure Modes and Structural Vulnerabilities):

- **Layout**: Is it single-column? Multi-column templates scramble data in Workday, Taleo, and SAP (report lines 25-37).
- **Fonts**: Are standard fonts used (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, Helvetica)? Non-standard typography fails extraction (report line 32).
- **Bullets**: Are simple ASCII bullets used (-, *, o)? Complex Unicode symbols break list-parsing arrays (report line 33).
- **Headings**: Are standard section headings used ("Work Experience", "Education", "Skills")? Unconventional headings fail section-recognition engines (report lines 34-35).
- **File format**: Is it a text-selectable PDF or DOCX? Image-based PDFs fail entirely — auto-rejection (report line 34).

Flag any violations with the specific remediation from the report's Parser Failure Mode table.

#### Dimension 2: Keyword Alignment

Apply the deterministic keyword-matching frameworks from the report (Section: Traditional Deterministic and Keyword-Based Models):

- Extract all hard skills, technical terms, certifications, and domain-specific acronyms from the job description.
- Cross-reference against the resume text. Flag every JD keyword absent from the resume.
- Score alignment using the skill-match ratio: matched skills / total JD skills (report lines 78-81).
- Identify high-value terms that appear only once — the report establishes that term frequency matters: "high-value keywords should appear multiple times across the document" (report line 196).
- Note: Verbatim vocabulary alignment is heavily rewarded. Synonyms and variant terminology are penalized (report line 13).

#### Dimension 3: Knockout Readiness

Apply prescreening logic gates from the report (Section: Prescreening Architectures and Knockout Logic):

- Identify likely knockout questions from the JD: work authorization, minimum years of experience, mandatory certifications/licenses, degree requirements, location requirements (report lines 45-49).
- Check the resume for explicit evidence addressing each likely knockout criterion.
- Flag criteria not visibly addressed in the resume — these trigger auto-disqualification with zero human review (report line 47).
- Distinguish Required vs. Asset criteria (report lines 52-59). JD terms like "must have", "required", "minimum" map to Required criteria. Terms like "preferred", "nice to have", "bonus" map to Asset criteria — missing Asset terms won't disqualify but will prevent top-tier ACE categorization (report line 58).

#### Dimension 4: Vendor-Specific Risks and Opportunities

If a vendor was identified in Phase 2, apply the corresponding profile from `references/vendor-guide.md`. Key gotchas by vendor:

- **Oracle Taleo**: Extremely rigid parser, two-column = instant failure, strict pattern-matching on section headings. Optimize for ACE categorization by hitting Asset criteria (report lines 56-58, 116-120).
- **Workday**: Uses skills intelligence and skills cloud. Include adjacent/related skills, not just exact matches. Structured interview scorecards — bullet point quality matters (report lines 122-128).
- **iCIMS**: Heavy keyword density and section-recognition engine. Role Fit ranking is per-job and strict. Favor exact term repetition across experience entries (report lines 132-136).
- **Greenhouse**: AI-first but assistive. Uses weighted calibrations and interview scorecards. Keyword Suggestions feature generates filters from the JD — mirror JD language precisely (report lines 138-147).
- **SAP SuccessFactors**: Often integrates with third-party AI (Sniper AI, Phenom, Paradox AI). Knockout questions may be delivered via chatbot before ATS engagement (report lines 150-153).
- **Eightfold AI**: Uses neural embeddings and deep learning. Synonyms and transferable skills are recognized. Quantified outcomes and methodologies matter more than exact keyword repetition (report lines 155-160).

If no vendor is identified, apply the general deterministic scoring framework.

#### Dimension 5: Regional Context

If the user specified a non-US region, load `references/regional-guide.md` and apply region-specific keyword strategies.

For US-based roles, ensure compliance keywords for regulated industries (finance, healthcare, defense) are present if applicable.

### Phase 4: Generate Output(s)

Based on the user's choice in Phase 1, produce one or both:

#### Option A: Recommendations Document

Generate a structured report with:

1. **Overall ATS compatibility score** (qualitative: High/Medium/Low pass probability)
2. **Format issues** — each with the specific parsing failure mode and remediation, citing report section
3. **Missing keywords** — ranked by importance, organized by category (skills, certifications, domain terms, soft skills)
4. **Knockout gaps** — criteria likely to trigger auto-rejection with suggested resume additions
5. **Vendor-specific recommendations** — tailored to the identified ATS platform
6. **Regional adjustments** — if applicable
7. **Priority action list** — top 5-10 changes in order of impact

Every recommendation must reference the specific report section or line number that supports it.

#### Option B: Rewritten Resume

Create a new file (never overwrite the original). The filename should be the original name with `-ats-optimized` appended before the extension (e.g., `resume.pdf` → `resume-ats-optimized.pdf`).

Apply all format fixes, keyword insertions, and knockout gap closures identified in Phase 3. Preserve the original content and structure as much as possible while:

- Ensuring single-column layout with standard headings
- Embedding missing keywords naturally into experience bullets, not as a keyword-stuffed list
- Adding explicit evidence for knockout criteria near the top of the resume (summary section, or first experience entry)
- Increasing keyword frequency for high-value terms across multiple sections
- Including quantified achievements for AI-first platforms (Eightfold, Greenhouse)

After writing, produce a summary of changes made, with each change citing the report justification.

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER modify or overwrite the original resume file.** Always create a new file.
- **Every recommendation or change must cite the specific report section** that justifies it (e.g., "Report Section: Parsing Failure Modes — Two-Column Templates").
- **Contextual embedding**: Never stuff keywords into a standalone list. Integrate them into experience bullets and the summary.
- **Preserve authenticity**: Do not fabricate skills, experiences, or credentials the candidate does not possess.

## Gotchas

- **PDFs may appear text-selectable but contain embedded images of text**: The Read tool extracts text, but if the result is garbled or empty, the PDF may be image-based — flag this as a critical parsing risk per report line 34.
- **Company uses multiple ATS vendors**: Large enterprises may use Workday for HCM and Greenhouse for recruiting. Prioritize the recruiting-specialized vendor (Greenhouse) over the HCM platform (Workday) for optimization strategy.
- **URL redirects**: Greenhouse-hosted career portals often redirect from the company's main domain. If the initial URL is a company page, follow the "Apply" link to detect the actual ATS.
- **Job postings behind login walls**: If the job posting is on LinkedIn or behind authentication, ask the user to paste the full job description text.
- **Region affects more than keywords**: EU companies operating under the EU AI Act may use different ATS configurations that emphasize transparent, explainable scoring over black-box ranking. ASEAN and Middle Eastern markets have distinct regulatory terminology requirements (see `references/regional-guide.md`).
